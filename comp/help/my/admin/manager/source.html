<help page="Source Manager">

<p>A Source is the party responsible for providing a certain content item.
Partner sites, your own site, freelancers and news services are just a few
examples of potential Sources. On first use, you will find only one Source in
the system. This one, temporarily entitled "Internal Source," will be used to
attribute content items to your site. You are encouraged to rename this Source
with your company's name and to add any Sources from which you will receive
content. Once you have created a Source, you can give it credit by selecting it
from a content item's Profile page.</p>
