<help page="Desks">

<p>The Desks structure allows you and other Bricolage users to share and
exchange assets.</p>

<p>After you create and save a new asset, it resides on your Workspace by
default. You can then check it in to a Desk to make it accessible to others in
your company's community. Once a user from one Desk edits and approves the
asset, he or she will move it to the next Desk and the process will repeat until
the asset is ready to be published.</p>

<p>A Desk looks and operates a lot like your Workspace -- it's just a common
space version. If a photograph media asset resides on the &quot;Art Desk,&quot;
as an example, any user who has access to the &quot;Art Desk&quot; will have
access to the photograph, though only one at a time can edit it.</p>

    may not be checked out to another user until it is first checked back in to
    the Desk. If the asset is checked out to another use, this the name of the
    user who has the asset checked out will be displayed, rather than this
    link.</dd>
