<dt>Members</dt>
<dd>Determine which of the available users will be members of the Group. Select
    one at a time from the list on the left and click Add to List. The list on
    the right shows all of the Group's current members. To remove one, select
    the name and click Remove from List.</dd>

<dt>Permissions</dt>
<dd>Click this button to reach the Group's permissions page. For each
    permission, use the pulldowns to select the desired level of access. In
    ascending order, the levels of access are: None (the default), Read, Edit,
    Create. The final choice, Deny, works as a privileges leash for users and
    overrules the permissions granting of all other Groups. So if user Hank
    Smith is a member of a Group that has Deny selected for the Media Workflow,
    he will not be able to read, edit or create Media even if he is a member of
    another Group that does have such access.</dd>
