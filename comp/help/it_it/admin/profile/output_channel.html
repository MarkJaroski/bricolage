<dd>Enter the Output Channel's name and a brief description. With the
    &quot;Pre&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; fields, you can tell the output
    channel to associate a prefix directory or postfix directory to the URI of
    all resources (stories and media) in the output channel. This feature is
    useful if you're keeping different kinds of content on one delivery
    server. Enter the file name and extension for the stories files created in
    this output channel in the &quot;File Name&quot; and &quot;File
    Extension&quot; fields.<br /><br/>

    The URI Format properties determine how the URIs of stories and media will
    be created in this output channel. In the &quot;URI Format&quot; and
    &quot;Fixed URI Format&quot; fields, enter the tokens that represent the
    various parts out of which the URI should be made. Tokens must be
    separated by &quot;/&quot; like a URI. The currently available tokens are:
    &quot;categories&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;month&quot;,
    &quot;slug&quot;, and &quot;year&quot;. Assuming a story in the category
    &quot;/stories&quot;, whose slug is &quot;hello&quot;, and the date is
    February 27, 2002, the URI Format
    &quot;/day/month/year/categories/slug/&quot; would produce the URI
    &quot;/27/02/2002/stories/hello&quot;.<br /><br />

    The &quot;URI Case&quot; select list forces URIs in this output channel to
    be formatted in a particular case, either &quot;Mixed Case&quot; (the
    default), &quot;Lowercase&quot;, or &quot;Uppercase&quot;.<br /><br />

    The &quot;Use Slug for Filename&quot; field indicates that the names of
    the story files created in this output channel should use the slug when
    possible. This means that non-fixed stories will use the slug to name the
    file, if it's available. Fixed stories will instead use the name specified
    in the Filename field, while media will use the name of the media file
    itself.</dd>

<dt>Template Includes</dt>
<dd>Select existing Output Channels in order to include the templates of those
    Output Channels in this Output Channel. The idea here is that, when you
    preview or publish assets via this Output Channel, if the Burn system can't
    find a template, it'll look for it in the Output Channels selected here. The
    template includes can be ordered, and they will be searched for templates in
    that order.</dd>
