<help page="My Workspace">

<p>This is your home base. Here you will store all the assets you create before
checking them in to a Desk. You'll also be able to check assets out from other
Desks to edit them at your Workspace.</p>

<p>Click <i>My Workspace</i> in the upper left hand corner to return to this
screen at any time.</p>

<h3>Assets</h3>

<p>You can manage three different types of assets in your Workspace: Media,
Stories, and Templates. Newly created assets will reside in your Workspace until
you move them -- or check them in -- to a Desk.</p>

<p>By checking an asset into a Desk, you allow other permitted users to access
it. Desks are like stations in an assembly line - an asset needs to be approved
by each one before it is ready to ship out to consumers.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have created a new article for your Website. You
check it in to the Edit Desk, where an editor examines its structure and
accuracy. The editor then checks the article in to the Legal Desk, where a
lawyer makes sure it will not get you sued. Next it goes to the Copy Desk, to be
scrutinized for grammar and spelling. And finally, it is checked in to the
Publish Desk, where you can push it to the site.</p>

<p>At each of these points, the person who needs to edit the asset will check it
out, or move it to his or her Workspace. When an asset on a Desk is checked out
to a user, it remains listed on that Desk and other users can still view it, but
only the person who has checked it out can edit it.</p>
